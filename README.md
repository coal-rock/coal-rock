<h2 align="center"> Hi, I'm Cole <br/></h2>

### About Me
- Currently pursuing my BS in Computer Science at UAlbany
- Passionate about FOSS ("free" as in libre) and Copyleft
- Interested in experimental language design and compiler architecture

### Dogma
- Anyone who argues that blockchain can solve X either doesn't understand blockchain, or doesn't understand X
- Copyright is both a net loss for innovation and the free market
- Software enshittification is real and must be mitigated at all costs
